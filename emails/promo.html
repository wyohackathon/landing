				<h2><strong>Scott Stornetta<br></strong></h2>
				<p style="text-align: left">Dr. Stornetta is considered by many to be the co-inventor of the Blockchain. Dating back to 1991, his pioneering series of papers, written with co-author Dr. Stuart Haber at Bellcore, received the 1992 Discover Award for Computer Software, and were featured in the New York Times in 1995. This helped lay the foundation for Bitcoin and other digital currencies (for example, of the eight citations in the original Bitcoin paper, three reference his and Dr. Haber’s work).</p>
				<p style="text-align: left">Dr. Stornetta was Assistant General Manager of the 125-person Mathematical and Computer Sciences Laboratory.  Dr. Stornetta consulted for many years, evaluating the commercial potential of emerging technologies on behalf of universities, commercial research labs, and venture capital interests. Along with Dr. Haber, he co-founded Surety, a Bellcore spinoff.  Surety’s offering constituted the first commercial deployment of a blockchain.</p>
				<p style="text-align: left">Dr. Stornetta received his Ph.D. in physics from Stanford University, after attending MIT, Harvard, and Brigham Young University.
