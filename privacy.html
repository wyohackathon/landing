        <h6>Last Updated: July 1, 2020</h6><br />
        <p>WyoHackathon together with its affiliated entities (“WyoHackathon”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share data, and what choices you have with respect to your data. We have updated this version of our Privacy Policy to reflect changes in data protection law.</p><br />
        <p>We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, so we encourage you to review it frequently. If we make any material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on our website prior to such change taking effect.</p>
        <h4>Applicability of the Privacy Policy</h4><br />
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all websites that we own and operate, and all related websites, our applications and/or APIs, and online services (our “Site”), as well as our other services, offerings, and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with us (together with our Site, collectively referred to as our “Services”). If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Services.</p><br />
        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services through our Site (“Third Party Services”), or any other third party products, services or businesses.</p>
        <h4>Information We Collect and Receive</h4><br />
        <p>We collect personal information about you in the following ways:</p><br />
        <h5>Information you give us</h5><br />

        <h5>Information from Social Networking Sites</h5><br />
        <p>Our Site includes interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking sites (each a “SNS”). If you connect to a SNS through our Site you authorize us to access, use and store the information that you agreed the SNS could provide to us based on your settings on that SNS. We will access, use and store that information in accordance with this Notice. You can revoke our access to the information you provide in this way at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS.</p><br />
        <h5>Information we get from others</h5><br />

        <p>We also may obtain information from those in the WyoHackathon network such as our event organizers, contractors, and local representatives who have agreed to a relationship with us in order to deliver our Services. This may include information about potential interest in our programs, company and individual progress, interest in local events, and attendance at other similar events.</p><br />
        <h5>Information automatically collected</h5><br />
        <p>We may automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our Site. For example, we may log your computer or mobile device operating system name and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, browser language, screen resolution, the website you visited before browsing to our Site, pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times and information about your use of and actions on our Site. We collect this information about you using cookies. Please refer to the Cookies and Similar Technologies section for more details.</p><br />
        <h5>Changes to your personal information</h5><br />
        <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please let us know if your personal information changes during your relationship with us by updating your registration profile or emailing us at privacy@wyohackathon.io.</p>
        <h4>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4><br />
        <p>What are cookies?</p><br />
        <p>We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.</p><br />
        <p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>
        <h4>Cookies we use</h4><br />
        <p>Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p><br />
        <p><i>Essential Cookies</i></p>
        <p>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p><br />
        <p><i>Analytics and Performance Cookies</i></p>
        <p>These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site.</p><br />
        <p>We use Matomo for this purpose.</p>
        <iframe style="border: 0; height: 200px; width: 100%;" src="https://stats.lode.network/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=en&backgroundColor=&fontColor=&fontSize=&fontFamily="></iframe>
        <h4>Disabling cookies</h4><br />
        <p>You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the "settings," "help" "tools" or "edit" facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.</p><br />
        <p>Further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p><br />
        <p>If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Site. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site.</p>
        <h4>Pixel tags</h4><br />
        <p>We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Site to track the actions of users on our Site. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users’ personal information.</p>
        <h4>Do Not Track Signals</h4><br />
        <p>Some Internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to do not track signals. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>

        <p>We may make available on our Site, or link to, features that allow you to share information online (e.g., on message boards, in chat areas, in file uploads, through events, etc.).

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy you will be notified via e-mail (if you have an account where we have your contact information) or another manner through the Services that we believe reasonably likely to reach you (which may include posting a new privacy policy on our Site – or a specific announcement on this page or on our blog).</p><br />
        <p>Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Site (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of our Services after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.</p><br />
        <h3>Retention</h3><br />
        <p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p><br />
        <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p><br />
        <p>In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p><br />

We will delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably practicable.</p><br />

We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.</h3><br />
        <p>References to "personal information" in this Privacy Policy are equivalent to "personal data" governed by European Union data protection legislation. We use the following safeguards if WyoHackathon transfers personal information originating from the European Union to other countries not deemed adequate under applicable data protection law:</p><br />
        <h3>Controller</h3><br />

        <h3>E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield</h3><br />

WyoHackathon has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome.</p><br />
        <p>We are responsible for the processing of personal data received under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequent transfers to third parties acting as agents on our behalf.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, WyoHackathon is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. We commit to cooperate with the EU data protection authorities and comply with advice given by such authorities with respect to any human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p><br />
        <p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact WyoHackathon at privacy@wyohackathon.io. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, you may contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at http://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.</p><br />
        <p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p><br />
